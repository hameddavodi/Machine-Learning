K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm used in machine learning and data mining to partition a set of data points into a fixed number (k) of clusters. The goal of k-means clustering is to group the data points in such a way that the points within a group (cluster) are similar to each other and different from the points in other groups.

The k-means algorithm starts by randomly selecting k initial cluster centers, and then iteratively assigns each data point to the nearest cluster center, and re-computes the center of each cluster as the mean of the points assigned to it. The process is repeated until the cluster centers converge, that is, until the assignment of data points to clusters no longer changes significantly.

The k-means algorithm has several advantages, including its simplicity, computational efficiency, and effectiveness in handling large datasets. However, it also has some limitations, such as the sensitivity to the initial choice of cluster centers and the assumption that the clusters are spherical and have equal variance.

K-means clustering has a wide range of applications, including image segmentation, customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and document clustering.
